# Image Gaze

A Firefox add-on to show large previews of images or links that lead to images.

# [Find out more and get it at Mozilla's add-on centre.](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-gaze/)

## Development

1. Get the [Firefox Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK). This requires Python 2, but I am running it with Python 3 without any problems.
2. Activate the development environment, i.e. `addon-sdk-1.17\bin\activate`.
2. Run the add-on in a clean Firefox instance with `cfx run`.
